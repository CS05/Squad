# Squad
A social network to get people back together as the COVID pandemic in the United States comes to an end.

Find a location that you like and tap a button to plan a hangout. 
You can choose a time range that works for you, and invite friends.
Your friends can choose their own time frame, and the app will find a time that works best for everyone.
